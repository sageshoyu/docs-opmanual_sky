# Mapping and Localization {#mapping status=ready}

The Duckiedrone can perform localization with a map created from an
image, as well as the ability to run SLAM (online or offline).  Both
methods use the drone's camera to produce a pose estimate, but
localization requires a map of the environment before hand,
represented as images stitched together (map.jpg) whereas SLAM builds
a map of the environment as it runs. SLAM does not run well online
even with a fast base station. However it gives good performance when
run offline to create a map, and then later using that map to
localize. 

These scripts replace the `vision_flow_and_phase.py` script that does
velocity and position control.  The reason is that we save time and
memory by avoiding sending images to different nodes on the Pi and
instead do all processing in a single node that directly connects to
the camera.

The recommended workflow is to first run SLAM to create a map offline.
Then after creating the map, run localization with the saved map to
give the drone a global position estimate. 

## SLAM

The recommended mode for SLAM is to run it offline; there is not
enough compute even offboard to run it during flight.  It may be
possible to run SLAM online with additional optimization or by
rewriting the algorithm in C++; for this reason we include
instructions for running online as well.  Note that if you run
anything offboard, ROS must be installed on the offboard machine.
Running offboard is not required to run SLAM; however it may be
significantly faster to create the map if you use a fast base station.

For offline slam:

**Onboard**: run `vision_localization_onboard.py --SLAM --offline` on
  the Pi. To create the map, first take off.  Once the drone is in the air,
press `m` to toggle mapping mode on, during which time you can fly to
collect data for the map. Pressing `m` again will stop the mapping and
begin running SLAM offline.  Then land the drone.  Once it tells you
that it is finished making the map, press `r` to toggle localization
over the map you have just made.  


**Offboard**: run `vision_localization_offboard.py --offline` on the
  Pi. On the offboard computer run `offboard_slam.py`.  This will make
  the map, but there is currently no way to use the map to localize.


Online SLAM runs but not in real time, even offboard.  Therefore we do
not recommend it until and unless we make it fast enough to run in
realtime.  However we are including instructions in case someone wants
to try!  For online slam:

**Offboard:** run `vision_localization_offboard.py` on the pi. On the
  offboard computer run `offboard_slam.py`. Press `r` to toggle SLAM.

**Onboard:** run `vision_localization_onboard.py --SLAM` on the
  pi. Press `r` to toggle SLAM.


<!--
 Once the map has been created, you can use it to localize by running:
  `vision_localization_onboard.py --SLAM --offline --read [name of map
  file]`. Press `r` to toggle localization as if you were running the
  normal localization code.

## Localization with a Stitched Map

These instructions describe how to create a stitched image of a map
with your cell phone or other camera.  Once you have created a map,
you can use it to localize.

Take photos of the new map with a cell phone or other camera. Take
  them at a height of $25\mbox{cm}$ pointed downward at the workspace.
  Use an image stitching software to generate the map. We recommend
  [auto-stitch](http://matthewalunbrown.com/autostitch/autostitch.html)
  or [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/). Replace map.jpg with your
  new map and change the following four parameters in
  `offboard_localization.py`, `onboard_localization.py`, and
  `localization_helper.py`: MAP_PIXEL_WIDTH, MAP_PIXEL_HEIGHT,
  MAP_REAL_WIDTH, MAP_REAL_HEIGHT. You may need to resize the image to
  be smaller if it is too large.


**Onboard:** run `vision_localization_onboard.py` on the pi. You must fly over the area captured in map.jpg. Press `r` in the web interface to toggle localization.

**Offboard:** run `vision_localization_offboard.py` on the pi and `offboard_localization.py` on the remote computer. You must fly over the area captured in map.jpg. Press `r` to toggle localization.
