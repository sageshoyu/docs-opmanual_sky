# Part 1: Raspberry Pi and Power Distribution Instructions {#build-part1-instructions status=ready}

**Expected Time**: 3 hours

## Preliminary Tasks

### Charge the Battery

1. Start charging your drone battery so it is ready when you need it.

Note: **Never** leave the battery charging unattended. The battery takes about 2 hours to charge

### Download Image and Image Flashing Software

1. If you have not already, on a base station, download the image flashing tool [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

1. If you have not already, on a base station, download the latest drone [image](#materials-file-downloads).

1. Connect the micro SD card to the workstation. Use the micro SD to USB card reader if the base station does not have a micro SD port.

1. Open Etcher and select the downloaded drone image. Then select the micro SD card as the drive to flash. Finally, click the "Flash" button.

Note: Double check that the "drive" is your micro SD card. You may be prompted to enter the base station password to proceed. This is normal; flashing an SD card deletes everything that is on it, so Etcher is making sure this process is OK with you.

Note: flashing will take 1 - 2 hours. In the meantime, you can move on to the next sections.

## Attach the Pin Header to the Pi Hat

### Identify the front and back

Identify the side of the Pi Hat that has writing on it - this side is the front, and the side without writing is the back. Tip: take note of where the slot slot in the Pi Hat to help with matching the orientation in the following instructions.

</figure>

### Solder the Pin Header

1. Review the [through-hole soldering technique](#prereq-solder-through-hole)

1. Use the helping hands to assist as you solder the pin header

***video tutorial***: [video instructions part 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRUzxmqFLdeEPoKqYJNIGYimHYFPo2lI/view?usp=sharing)

Note: It's very easy to add too much solder and create a solder bridge between adjacent pins. Visually inspect your soldering to make sure that adjacent pins are not connected by globs of solder. If you have a solder bridge, try the technique shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJPLs7J4oCk). If this does not work, you can use desoldering wick or a solder sucker to remove the excess solder.

<div class='check' markdown="1">
Sometime too much heat when soldering the pin header can mess up the Pi Hat connections. To make sure the connections are still good, do a [connectivity check](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_multimeter.html) on the Pi Hat; verify there is:

- A short between the hole labelled SDA on the Pi Hat and the pin at row 2 column 1 of the pin header that you soldered.

<figure>  
   <figcaption>Check for SDA connection</figcaption>
   <img style='width:150px' src="photos/check-scl.png"/>

- A short between the hole labelled SCL on the Pi Hat and the pin at row 3 column 1 of the pin header that you soldered.

If you make a mistake while soldering, review the [instructions for fixing soldering mistakes](#prereq-solder-mistakes)


## Attach the LED and Resistor to the Pi Hat

Solder the 680 Ohm resistor and your LED to the Pi Hat as shown in the image.

Note: The direction of the resistor does not matter, but the direction of the LED **does matter.** Be sure to place the cathode (shorter end) into the GND rail.

<figure>  
   <figcaption>Extra resistor wire snipped</figcaption>
   <img style='width:216px' src="photos/pihat-with-led.png"/>
</figure>


You've just finished the LED circuit! In a future lesson, you will learn how to send electricity through GPIO pin #6 to the LED and resistor, and then back to ground.

## Attach the BEC to the Pi Hat

### Prepare

Cut the black plastic piece off the BEC **OUT** wires

<figure>
   <figcaption>BEC preparation</figcaption>
   <figure>
       <figcaption>BEC wires pre-cut</figcaption>
       <img style='width:250px' src="photos/bec_precut.jpg"/>
   </figure>
   <figure>
       <figcaption>BEC wires post-cut (not yet stripped)</figcaption>
       <img style='width:250px' src="photos/bec_postcut.jpg"/>
   </figure>
</figure>

### Strip and Tin

1. Strip the end of the red and black **OUT** wires (the wires you just cut) so that there is about 5mm of exposed wire.

1. Twist together the ends of the wires and *lightly* tin them. The wires need to be thin enough to fit through the holes in the Pi Hat.

### Solder

Solder the BEC **red (+)** OUT wire to the +5V Rail, and solder the BEC **black (-)** OUT wire to the GND rail, as shown in the image.

 Remark: Any hole on the rails will work; however, for wire organization, it is better to use a hole on the 5V rail that is shown. If you mess up soldering, it is ok to leave the mistake and use a different hole.

***video tutorial***: [video instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dWkcTCSyBB6qZfQMVru1hSIyZC1fnxfx/view?usp=sharing) (please ignore the extra wires and components that are already attached to the Pi Hat in the video)

<div class='check' markdown="1">

Do a [connectivity check](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_multimeter.html) on the Pi Hat. Verify there is:

 - **no short** between the +5V rail and the GND rail on the Pi Hat

</div>

## Prepare the PDB

### Tin the PDB

Similar to exposed wires, the metal pads on a PDB need to be tinned. This will allow tinned wires to be joined to the pads - and therefore the PDB.

1. Review the [pad-tinning tutorial](#prereq-tin-pad)

1. Tin every pad on the PDB, **except** the 5V and 12V pads.

Note: Be careful not to aggresively push the soldering iron tip into the PDB, as too much force will cut the pads right off!

<figure>
    <figcaption>Tinned PDB</figcaption>

</figure>

***video tutorial***: [video instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xVlTBsAtarXKaJycGvJ66VYyJhe6loq3/view?usp=sharing)

Note: For the remainder of the instructions, unless stated otherwise, **red** wires should be soldered to **positive (+)** pads and **black wires** should be soldered to **ground (-)** pads.

## Solder the BEC to the PDB

### Tin

Tin the ends of the red and black wires that are connected to the side of the BEC that is labeled **IN**

### Solder

Solder the BEC **red (+)** IN wire to the **positive (+)** pad on the PDB, and solder the **black (-)** IN wire to the **negative (-)** pad on the PDB, as shown in the image.

Note: Any of the tinned (+) pads will work; however, using the pad shown in the image will help with wire organization later on.

***video tutorial:*** [solder BEC to PDB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j81xCk6fAeutRMZY-X9wH2JQ-ylNwIOQ/view?usp=sharing) (Please ignore the additional wires on the PDB, as well as which pads the BEC is soldered to - just observe the technique)

## Solder the XT60 Battery Connector to the PDB

### Strip and Tin

1. Strip the ends of the battery connector so that about 1cm of wire is exposed

1. Tin the exposed ends of the XT60 connector

### Solder

Solder the XT60 **red (+)** wire to the tinned positive (+) pad on the PDB, and solder the **black (-)** wire to the tinned ground (-) pad on the PDB, as shown in the image.

Note: This wire is very thick and it will take a while for the solder to melt. Make sure your soldering iron is turned all the way up and be patient.

Note: Do **not** solder the wires flat against the PDB - solder them at ~20&deg; angle away from the board. If you solder them flat, then you will not be able to fit the PDB into the drone frame.   


<figure>
    <figcaption>XT60 soldered to PDB</figcaption>
    <img style='width:300px' src="photos/pdb-with-xt60.png"/>
</figure>


<div class='check' markdown="1">

Visually inspect the drone to verify the following:

  - All red wires connected to the PDB are connected to positive (+) pads

  - All black wires connected to the PDB are connected to negative (-) pads

  - The wires on the IN side - **NOT** the OUT side - of the BEC are soldered to the PDB

Do a [connectivity check](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_multimeter.html) on the PDB; verify there is:

  - a short between any positive (+) pad and any other positive (+) pad

  - a short between any negative (-) pad and any other negative (-) pad

  - **no short** between any positive (+) pad and any negative (-) pad

**ONLY** if the connectivity check passed, do a [DC voltage check](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_multimeter.html) on the PDB; plug in a 12V battery and verify there is:

  - ~0V between any positive (+) pad and any other positive (+) pad

  - ~0V between any negative (-) pad and any other negative (-) pad

  - ~12V between any positive (+) pad and any negative (-) pad.

  NOTE: If the battery is X volts instead of 12 volts (e.g. 10), then the multimeter will show X volts instead of 12 volts.

**ONLY** if the DC voltage check passed, re-connect a battery to your drone and verify the following:

  - The bottom of the drone frame is illuminating, due to the LEDs on the bottom of the PDB.

## Final Steps

<div class='check' markdown="1">
Do another [connectivity check](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_sky/out/build_multimeter.html) to verify that there is **no short** between the +5V rail and the GND rail on the Pi Hat.

### Verify that the Pi has power

1. Connect the battery

2. Verify that the BEC has a solid greed light.

3. Verify that the Pi has a solid red light.

### Insert the SD card into the Pi

Insert your (now flashed) SD card into the SD card slot on the bottom of the Pi.

Note: The SD card direction does matter - the lettering on the SD card should be facing downward.
