## Base station {#materials-base-station}

In order to fly the drone, you must have a laptop or personal computer that is capable of connecting to the internet. Additionally, your will need to install the following software on your base station.

### OS requirements

At this time, it is not possible to flash your SD card on a Chrome book; therefore you will need a linux, windows, or mac device to configure SD card during the build, but you can use any OS after this the configuration.

### Browser Requirements

Google Chrome is recommended. You will need to download a Chrome app later on, so is best to install Chrome now. Safari will work for flying. Microsoft Edge does not work.

### Software Requirements

**Flashing the SD card:**

1. [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). You cannot complete this step if you are using a Chromebook.

**Configuring the Flight Controller:**

1. [Cleanflight](http://cleanflight.com/). This is a Google Chrome application.

1. [USB to UART driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers). Download the correct driver for your OS. You will not need this driver if you are using a Chromebook; you will be able to connect to the flight controller without it.
